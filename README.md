## Challenge
**Update Possible Challenge**
---
## Core Idea
### **Safeguard – The Trust & Compliance Layer for Eclipse SDV OTA**
Modern vehicles are rolling software platforms. The **Eclipse SDV stack** (Symphony + Ankaios + Zenoh + Muto) already enables containerized, modular OTA updates. But **real-world deployments require more than orchestration** — they need **trust, compliance, and transparency.**
Current gaps:
- Symphony + Ankaios can orchestrate OTA, but…
  - No **driver consent flow**.
  - No **dependency enforcement** across ECUs.
  - No **vehicle state awareness** (safe update conditions).
  - No **traceable audit history** for regulations like **UN R155/R156**.
**Safeguard** is our OSS enhancement that plugs into the Eclipse SDV stack and makes it **enterprise/OEM-ready.**
With Safeguard, OTA isn’t just about pushing updates — it’s about ensuring **trust, compliance, and laying the foundation for tomorrow’s intelligence.**
### Key Features of Safeguard
- **Driver Approval** – Consent workflow via dashboard/app → driver-in-the-loop for safety.
- **Dependency Check** – Update order validated across ECUs (HPC → Battery → Motor ECU).
- **Vehicle State Condition** – Only execute if vehicle is stationary, battery safe, critical ECUs idle.
- **Update Tracker** – Lifetime history of OTA actions → regulatory compliance + OEM insights.
- **AI-Ready Data** – Tracker produces structured logs → future AI for predictive updates & anomaly detection.
> With Safeguard, Eclipse SDV’s OTA becomes **not just functional, but trusted, compliant, and competitive with closed-source OEM stacks.**

### Business Value & Differentiation
- **Regulation-ready**: Traceability ensures easier compliance with UN R155 (cybersecurity) and R156 (software updates).
- **Competitive with OEM solutions**: Safeguard brings compliance + trust to Eclipse SDV OTA, making OSS viable for real-world fleets.
- **OEM Differentiation**: Driver approval & state-awareness = marketable as a “safe update” feature.
- **Future AI**: Tracker data becomes the foundation for predictive insights → fleet maintenance optimization, energy-aware updates.

# 2. How Do You Work
## Development Process
* Agile, iterative sprints: prototype → OTA orchestration → testing in simulator.
* Focus on Driver Approval, Dependency Check, Vehicle State Condition, and Update Tracker integration.
  
## Planning & Tracking
- Used GitHub Projects + Issues for task tracking.

## Quality Assurance
- Unit testing for update orchestration logic.
- Code reviews of all PRs
- Automated unit and integration tests in simulated vehicles.

## Communication
- Slack + GitHub for async communication.

## Decision Making
- Collaborative → quick discussions in team calls.
- Final technical decisions made by consensus, prioritizing hackathon deadlines.
